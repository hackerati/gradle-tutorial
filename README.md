Directory structure as expected by Gradle

```
mkdir -p src/main/java
mkdir -p src/main/resources
mkdir -p src/test/java
mkdir -p src/test/resources 
```

```gradle build``` - builds your project

```gradle clean``` - deletes the build directory

```gradle assemble``` - compiles and jars your code, but does not run the unit tests

```gradle check``` - compiles and tests your code

```gradle uploadArchives``` - publish the JAR file according to build.gradle file

```gradle eclipse``` - generate the Eclipse project file
